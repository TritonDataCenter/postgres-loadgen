Run 2

- When: 2018-09-13T22:08Z to 2018-09-18T00:50Z
- Manual "VACUUM FREEZE" from 2018-09-17T17:53:59Z to 2018-09-17T23:12:07Z.
- Applied OS-7151 workaround at 2018-09-17T21:24:54Z.

Notes:
- Created a new dataset for the database with an 8K recordsize.
- The data from this experiment has been reasonably smooth.
- There was no observable impact on latency or throughput for the normal vacuum
  operations.  Shortly before running out of space, I manually kicked off a
  "VACUUM FREEZE" (see above for timing), which had a major impact on both of
  these.
- After observing the massive degradation, I made a few observations:
  - Dirty buffer writes by non-checkpointer, non-bgwriter backends went up as
    we've seen in other experiments.  However, I did not see dirty buffers
    written by non-autovacuum backends.
  - The autovacuum process was spending over 80% of its time blocked in
    zfs_write() waiting for a transaction group to open.
  - There was neither ZFS write throttle activity (as reported by the
    `delay-mintime` DTrace probe) nor zone throttle activity (as reported by
    vfsstat).
  - There was a lot of metaslab loading and unloading.  I tested a workaround
    for OS-7151.  This was applied at 2018-09-17T21:24:54 and significantly
    improved average latency and throughput.
  - The effect on read throughput was essentially the same as the effect on
    write throughput.

Observations of note about the system:
- I discovered the source of the occasional periodic spikes in
  buffers-written-by-backends.  They're coming from ANALYZE activity.
- After about 24 hours, the database has grown to about 16.5 GiB.  Average
  latency climbed slowly from 4ms to 16ms, with tuple operations declining from
  a little over 1000 inserts per second to about 250.
- Autovacuums activity has not had any notable impact on even p99 latency,
  except maybe a handful of spikes from about 150ms to about 200ms.
- Manual "VACUUM FREEZE" impact had major impact.  See notes above.
